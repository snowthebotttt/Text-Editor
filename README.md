# Text Editor

## Description

For Challenge 19 of the bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a text editor that runs in the browser. However, I encountered difficulties while setting up and running the development server. Although I added the necessary event handlers, implemented the putDb and getDb methods, and included workbox plugins and CSS loaders, I was unable to get the app working properly.
